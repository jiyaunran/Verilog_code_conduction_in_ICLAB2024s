# Lab05 Matrix convolution, max pooling and transposed convolution
This lab receive 16 images in a row which can be size of (8x8,16x16,32x32) and receive 16 different kernel with fixed size 5x5. Then do the convolution or deconvolution randomly with random picked image and kernel pair. 

The storage is SRAM compiled with memory compiler which is confidential and will only be shown as functional block.
